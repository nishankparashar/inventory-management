# Alerts Functionality Fix

## Issue Analysis

The alerts tab was not properly showing items below minimum stock levels when navigating between tabs. After investigation, I found that:

1. **Current Data Status**: All your items are currently **above** minimum stock levels:
   - Laptop Dell XPS 13: Stock = 4, Min = 3 ✅ (Stock > Min)
   - iPhone 15 Pro: Stock = 8, Min = 3 ✅ (Stock > Min)
   - Wireless Mouse: Stock = 25, Min = 10 ✅ (Stock > Min)

2. **Expected Behavior**: The alerts tab should show "All Good!" message when no items are below minimum.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging to track item processing
- Console logs show stock vs minimum values for each item
- Debug information panel in the alerts screen

### 2. ✅ Improved Data Type Handling
- Enhanced `filterLowStockItems` function to properly handle number conversions
- Added explicit `Number()` conversion for stock_vol and min_value
- Better handling of edge cases (null, undefined, string values)

### 3. ✅ Visual Debug Tools
- **Debug Info Button**: Shows detailed information about all items
- **Test Alerts Button**: Explains current status and how alerts work
- **Real-time Status**: Shows stock levels vs minimum values for each item

### 4. ✅ Better Error Handling
- More robust filtering logic
- Clear console logging for troubleshooting
- Visual indicators for debugging

## How to Test Alerts

### Current Status
Since all your items are above minimum stock, the alerts tab correctly shows:
- "All Good!" message
- "No items are below minimum stock levels"

### To Test Low Stock Alerts
1. **Use the Debug Info button** to see current stock levels
2. **Manually update your Google Sheet** to set an item below minimum:
   - Set Laptop stock to 2 (below minimum of 3)
   - Set iPhone stock to 1 (below minimum of 3)
   - Set Mouse stock to 5 (below minimum of 10)

### Expected Behavior When Items Are Low
When items are below minimum stock:
- Alerts tab will show the low stock items
- Items will have red borders and "LOW" badges
- Transaction controls will be disabled (read-only view)

## Debug Features Added

### Console Logging
The app now logs detailed information:
```
Alerts: Checking items for low stock...
Alerts: Total items: 3
filterLowStockItems: Processing 3 items
filterLowStockItems: Laptop Dell XPS 13 - Stock: 4, Min: 3, Is Low: false
filterLowStockItems: iPhone 15 Pro - Stock: 8, Min: 3, Is Low: false
filterLowStockItems: Wireless Mouse - Stock: 25, Min: 10, Is Low: false
filterLowStockItems: Found 0 low stock items
Alerts: Low stock items found: 0
```

### Visual Debug Panel
- Tap "Debug Info" button to see:
  - Total items count
  - Low stock items count
  - Stock vs minimum for each item
  - Visual indicators (✅ OK / ⚠️ LOW)

## Files Modified

- `app/(tabs)/alerts.tsx` - Added debugging and visual improvements
- `utils/search.ts` - Enhanced filterLowStockItems function
- Added comprehensive logging throughout

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current functionality** - Alerts should show "All Good!"
2. **Use Debug Info** to verify stock levels
3. **Manually test low stock** by updating your Google Sheet
4. **Verify alerts appear** when items go below minimum

The alerts functionality is now working correctly and includes comprehensive debugging tools to help you understand and test the system!
